Resume Parser with OpenAI Integration
Project Overview
This project is a resume parser developed to efficiently extract and analyze information from resumes using OpenAI’s GPT models. Built with Python, this project utilizes a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure an isolated development environment.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the parser.
OpenAI API: Provides advanced natural language processing capabilities for parsing resume data.
Virtual Environment (venv): Manages project dependencies and isolates the development environment.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
Install Dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install openai
Verify Installation:
Create a test_openai.py file with the following content to ensure the openai module is working:

python
Copy code
import openai
print("OpenAI module is working.")
Run the script:

sh
Copy code
python test_openai.py
Project Details
Virtual Environment: A Python virtual environment (venv) is utilized to maintain a clean and isolated setup, ensuring that the openai package and other dependencies are managed effectively.

OpenAI Integration: The openai Python package is used to interact with OpenAI’s GPT models. This integration enables sophisticated parsing of resume text to extract key information such as skills, experience, and qualifications.

Script Functionality: The parse_resume.py script is designed to leverage the OpenAI API for natural language processing tasks. It parses resumes and extracts relevant details, demonstrating practical use of AI for text analysis.

Usage
Activate the Virtual Environment.
Run the Resume Parsing Script to process and extract information from resumes.
Conclusion
This project highlights the application of modern AI technology for text analysis, demonstrating the integration of OpenAI's API with Python. The use of a virtual environment ensures a well-managed development process, showcasing an effective approach to handling dependencies and project requirements.
